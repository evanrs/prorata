Start playing with a deployed instance of `prorata` now â€” head over to [`prorata.vercel.app`](https://prorata.vercel.app) or gawk at the unnecessarily large gif.

## For later, or never, it's your choice

To run your very own instance without too much hassle you'll just need `docker`. If you already have `docker` you're free to use the included `start` script which will execute the following commands from `./website/prorata`

```sh
docker build . -t evanrs-prorata
docker run -p 3000:3000 evanrs-prorata
```

Navigate to the root of this project and run `start`, like so

```sh
./start
```

And look at that, it's starting!

## And now, some pretty pictures

<div>
  <img width="3%">
  <img src="assets/preview.png" width="45%"/>
  <img width="3%">
  <img src="assets/preview-dark-mode.png" width="45%"/>
</div>

The same thing, *but on a tiny computer*

<div>
  <img width="3%">
  <img src="assets/mobile.png" width="45%" style="border-radius:1rem;"/>
  <img width="3%">
  <img src="assets/mobile-dark-mode.png" width="45%" style="border-radius:1rem;"/>
</div>

Thank you for coming to my ted talk.
