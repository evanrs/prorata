An angry investor sent us a note about how they keep getting squeezed down to $25K per deal even
though their requested amount is $100K. Underneath the hood, this was because there's limited
allocation (low supply) and a high volume of investors looking to invest (high demand). How should
we communicate this to an investor in a way that minimizes the damage to our relationship with
the investor?

In addition, can you think of a better way we could change the proration basis logic so that
this could potentially happen less often?
