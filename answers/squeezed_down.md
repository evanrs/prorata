# Prompt

An angry investor sent us a note about how they keep getting squeezed down to $25K per deal even
though their requested amount is $100K. Underneath the hood, this was because there's limited
allocation (low supply) and a high volume of investors looking to invest (high demand). How should
we communicate this to an investor in a way that minimizes the damage to our relationship with
the investor?

In addition, can you think of a better way we could change the proration basis logic so that
this could potentially happen less often?

### Technical Response

(See, discovering a bug)[discovering_a_bug.md] for our technical assement.

We need to asses to what extent we agree with how investors insight. We must also consider how this made them feel and whether it erodes trust in the platform. These two considerations drive both our technical priorities and our response them.

If we agree with their insight we have to know whether we produce an outcome our target investor would consider fair. Determing fair aportionment is a deep and fascinating subject — the criterion for which will be our current belief on what drives sustained growth with target investors. And, in its implementation do our best to measure impact to asses the correctness of those beliefs.

As for their feelings, it's key that they not only feel valued, but that their status as an investor on the platform is important to us. The experience of status — and our platform as vehicle for that — will be a key driver of retention, even when they do not like the outcome. So, how did they feel when they used our platform? What product changes would give them a sense of status? And, how can we know when investors like them _do not_ complain because they believe their status on the platform is both valuable and fair?

Questions are persistent, answers are transient — they will change over time with respect to the scope of our product. For now, we must fit the answers to our priorities for growth, retention, and product development.
